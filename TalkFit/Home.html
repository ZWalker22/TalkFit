        Your peace of mind and well-being are important to us which is why we
        feel that finding the right counsellor who fits your needs and lifestyle
        is the first step to getting the type of help you want. Counselling can
        help with:
      </p>
      <h4>
        Psychological distress
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are times when our normalcoping strategies leave us feeling
        confused or angry. Therapy can assistby helping us see a problem from a
        different perspective.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Substance
      </h4>
      <p>
        Misuse Therapy can help motivate you to make changes towards new
        routines with a short course of Motivational Enhancement Therapy. If you
        have already made changes and are abstaining from substance misuse then
        therapy can help you become aware of past history that may have led to
        the unwanted behaviour.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Anxiety
      </h4>
      <p>
        Anxiety can be crippling on a day to day basis. Therapy can help to
        reduce the level of threat and fear thereby enabling you to cope a
        little better. Young People You have mounds to cope with both mentally
        and physically. At a time when your brain is developing at speed and
        societal expectations are high, a non-judgemental, confidential space to
        talk can help.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Bereavement
      </h4>
      <p>
        The loss of someone close can be traumatic and confusing. Therapy can
        support you non-judgementally and sensitively through a dark time.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Stress
      </h4>
      <p>
        Stress can be unquantifiable and symptoms may have no apparent origin.
        Therapy may help identify the cause possibly enabling you to think and
        react in a different way alleviating some or all of the symptoms.
