      <h3>
        Ethics
      </h3>
      <p>
        Your peace of mind and well-being are important to us which is why we
        feel that finding the right counsellor who fits your needs and lifestyle
        is the first step to getting the type of help you want
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first point of contact will be over the phone. Together, we will
        confirm where we will meet, privacy issues and anything else that you
        feel is important to aid our initial meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first session we will discuss how we will work together. We will
        talk about your expectations from counselling and how the Person-Centred
        approach will work with anything you bring up in the sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide you would like to work with us, we will confirm together
        what time each week we will meet and frequency of sessions. This can be
        for a set period or ongoing. We will review the process on a regular
        basis to make sure you are receiving value for money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very occasionally we may collaboratively decide that a referral onto
        another service may be of benefit to you. You will always be consulted
        and your permission gained before a referral is made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Counselling is a unique experience and will mean different things to
        different people. We will work with you to ensure your best interests
        are cared for, and that your unique experience is right for you.
